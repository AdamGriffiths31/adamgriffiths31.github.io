    <p>
        A Guard Clause is a precondition. It is the idea that if you can return a result at the beginning of a method you should. Guard clauses should make your code more readable as it removes
        unneeded branching 'if' statements.

        How they work
    </h3>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-csharp">
            public static void TicketCost(int NumberOfPeople)
            {
                if(NumberOfPeople!=0)
                {
                    if(NumberOfPeople<10)
                    {
                        //Calculate Cost
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        //Too many people
                    }

                }
                else
                {
                    //Invalid
                }
            }
            </code>
  </pre>
  This block of code can be refactored to remove the need some of the branching.

<pre>
    <code class="language-csharp">
        public static void TicketCost(int NumberOfPeople)
        {
            if(NumberOfPeople==0)
            {
               return 0
            }
            if(NumberOfPeople<10)
            {
                //Too many people
            }
            
            //Calculate Cost

        }
        </code>

The code still functions the same but has become more readable. The Guard Clauses indicate that the method is not interested in certian cases, by having this at the top of the method it is much
clear to follow the logic.
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
Guard Clauses are a good way to improve the readability of complex logic branching. The benefit is that your code will tend to be shorter and simpler, and less deeply indented.
